=> Create a Portfolio Website 

I created a new project using the command prompt and the npm create vite@latest command, naming it PORTFOLIO-REACT. I selected React as the framework and JavaScript as the language.

After setting up the project, I opened it in Visual Studio Code. In the terminal, I ran the npm install command to install the necessary node_modules folder. I also added a new package, react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll, using the command npm install react-anchor-link-smooth-scroll.

To run the project, I used the npm run dev command.

Next, I created a components folder and within it, seven subfolders: Navbar, Hero, About, Services, MyWork, Contact, and Footer. In each of these folders, I created .js files for the components and corresponding .css files for styling.  All needed images were placed in an assets folder.

For email sending functionality, I used Web3Forms, which can be accessed at https://web3forms.com/. This service allows you to create a form page with mail sending capabilities.
